          <h2>I'm Chris Larder</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm Chris Larder my serial number... er I mean student number is s3777783. I'm an Australian of Filipino heritage. In a previous life, also known as 7 years ago. I graduated from Griffith University on the Gold Coast with a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Popular Music Media and Culture and Digital Video Production. I'm also a self-confessed muso. I've played the piano since I was 4 years old and guitar since I was 13. In my time I've played in multiple bands with varying levels of success.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason I've chosen to dive back into the world of academia is that during my previous study I was far more fascinated in the tech side of both of my majors. And since graduating I did have my own small online business for 3 years. After my business when under (like most new small businesses do) I found myself working for Woolworths as an Online Manager. During my time in that role, I found that there was so much more to how we use technology and machine learning to optimise business processes. The hopeful outcome I have for completing this course and then the rest of the Bachelor of Information Technology is to sort of upgrade my job.

          <h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
          <p>
            Ideally, I see myself working as a project manager in deploying software solutions to businesses. Like the one, I've found here. <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38506364" target="_blank">Link to Cool Job</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            The job advertised here is for a project manager looking after business to business relationships. Using their skills in SAP specifically to help optimise client's technology needs. For this job, I would need skills in SAP but to me, the most important part of this job is communication skills. In my current role I have already gained people and organisational skills. What I'm lacking in the technological skills that hopefully my studying at RMIT with fill in. My goal is to complete the Bachelor of IT at RMIT and use my experience with the courses to gain the skills needed for jobs like this.
